      <p>

            My name is Courtney. I was born and raised in Wichita, KS. I like working out, going to roller derby bouts, and reading fiction.
          </p>

          <p>
            I like imagining that I am in the Victorian Era(thank <i>you</i> Jane Austen).

          <p>I am an only child. I am multi-racial; on my mom's side of the family I am White and Swedish. On my dad's side of the family I am Native American and Black. I love my family and miss them dearly.</p>
          <p>This is my mom, Amanda. I am thankful to call her my mom.</p>

          <p>This is my late father, Willard. There's not a day that goes by that I don't miss his presence.</p>
